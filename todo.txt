To-do list
----------

Arthur
- Figure out good bounds for MCMC variables
  - In particular, use the relation between rsang, alphars, and the physical mass and truncation radius
  - Try fitting directly in terms of physical parameters, if that's not too difficult
- `emcee_subfit.ipynb` : figure out fit parameters as a function of redshift (get function from Cagan)
- `emcee_multifit.ipynb` : investigate how well we can learn multiple subhalo/interloper positions
+ How to get MCMC to work in complicated contexts
+ parallelization in `emcee` (if I'll be using that)
  - parallelization using MPI (important if we want to use the cluster for MCMC)
- total fit, where we adjust main lens parameters at the same time as interloper/subhalo parameters
- fitting interlopers as interlopers with z as a parameter (will this be agonizingly slow?)
- Use `dynesty` to get optimal fit!
  + getting started
